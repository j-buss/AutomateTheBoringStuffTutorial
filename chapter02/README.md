# Chapter 2 - Flow Control
Chapter 2 adds in the ability to control the execution of the program with the introduction of boolean and comparison operators, "if" blocks, and loops. Al finishes the chapter with the import statements which allow you to build with other's contributions.

### Lesson 4 - Flow charts, boolean values, comparison operators, boolean operators

#### Notes

**Comparison Operators**

Operator | Meaning
---------|---------
\==|Equal to
\!=|Not equal to
\<|Less than
\>|Greater than
\<=|Less than or equal to
\>=|Greater than or equal to

**Boolean Values**
- True
- False

**Boolean Operators**
- and
- or
- not

### Lesson 5 - if, elif, and else


#### Notes

**Flow Control**
- if statement: conditionally execute code 
- elif: executes if condition true and all previous have been false
- else: at the end; executes if all previous conditions have been false
- falsey values: 0, 0.0 and empty string '' are considered false; however better to be explicit in code

#### Code

Code Name|Referenced|Description
---------|----------|-----------
if_example.py|Lesson 5 Video|Basic if statement
if_else_example.py|Lesson 5 Video|Basic if-else statement
if_elif_example.py|Lesson 5 Video|Basic if-elif statement; without else
string_truthey_exmaple.py|Lesson 5 Video|if-else with implied "truth" from non-blank string
vampire.py|Book|if-elif multiple elifs
vampire2.py|Book|if-elif multiple elifs; with bug in order of elifs
littlekid.py|Book|if-elif-else

### Lesson 6 - 

**Loop**
- while: a loop which executes code, when reachs end of block, back to start, re-check condition
- break: leave current cycle of loop, do not re-check condition
- condition: leave current cycle of loop, back to start, and re-check condition

**Code from video**
- while_example.py
- yourName.py
- spam.py

**Code from book**
- yourName2.py
- infiniteloop.py
- swordfish.py

### Lesson 7
[for Loops and range()](https://youtu.be/HFQGxh1jY3g)

**For Loop**
- 
- range function - 

**Code from video**
- for_loop_gauss.py - for loop to return the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100
