## Lesson 5 - if, elif, and else
- Flow Control
  - if statement: conditionally execute code 
  - elif: executes if condition true and all previous have been false
  - else: at the end; executes if all previous conditions have been false
  - falsey values: 0, 0.0 and empty string '' are considered false; however better to be explicit in code
- Code from video:
  - if_example.py
  - if_else_example.py
  - if_elif_example.py
  - string_truthey_exmaple.py
- Code from Book:
  - vampire.py
  - vampire2.py
  - littlekid.py
