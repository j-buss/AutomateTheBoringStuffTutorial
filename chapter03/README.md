# Chapter 3 - Functions
In chapter 3 Al introduces us to functions. Functions are these really cool "black boxes" of logic. Simply send some input and get some output. From a code simplicity perspective these bits of code are great. They help you keep your common code together and by encapsulating the logic it helps abstract away some of the details.

## Summary Notes

- functions: essentially mini-programs created with _def_ statment, arguments, and return
- None: absence of a value; added to functions if they don't have explicit return
- argument: value passed in fucntion call
- parameter: variable inside the function
- keyword argument: argument added to a function call, but requires a keyword to identify the argumuent, generally optional
- scope: is an area of source code or "container" for variables
- global scope: is outside of all functions; cannot use any local variables from functions
- local scope: is inside a function; if there is an assignment in a function it is local
- try / except block: if an error happens in "try" block; the code in "except" block will execute; hopefully handling the error or displaying appropriate messages
