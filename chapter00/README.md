# Chapter 0
Chapter 0 is really about readying your environment for the rest of the book. 
The setup for Linux is likely one of the easier environments to get ready.
I am running the Linux(Beta) setup on my Acer Chrombook Spin 13.
## Ready the environment:
Open the shell and install the packages: 
1. sudo apt-get install python3
2. sudo apt-get install idle3
3. sudo apt-get install python3-pip
## Experiment with some commands
Open the idle [Integrated DeveLopment Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE) and try a "print" command.
- $ `idle3`
- >>> `print('Hello world!')`
