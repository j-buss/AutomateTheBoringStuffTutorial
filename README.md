# AutomateTheBoringStuffTutorial
A walk through each of the chapters of the book [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com). As I have used python for some time this was meant to be my summary of the chapters. This is not geared to an absolute beginner, but someone that has programmed before, but is not an expert.  

While the content of the AtBS is geared for a more general population versus a computer science/engineering background I did want to work through the book. It has come up in so many conversations pertaining to learning python. Additionally there are some topics later in the book that I am not very familiar with i.e. web scraping with Beautiful Soup and Selenium.
